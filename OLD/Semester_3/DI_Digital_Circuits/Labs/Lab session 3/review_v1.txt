All tasks: read "General introduction to IE3-DI Lab" page 2 fist paragraph and verify everything is given according to the guidelines

Lab task 2.1
	- there's a lot of VHDL and Xilinx code, but no test cases given. Veifying the correct operation of the circuit is the main task here, why there is no test cases' descriptions?
Lab task 2.2
	- Don't be overly precise with the measurements, two digits after the decimal point is enough
	- "All of this can be checked and compared with two Timing Reports (for Moore and Mealy respectively) on the next page." - where? how?
Lab task 2.3
	- The files can be found in "DI Lab 3\ISE 14\ISE_Projects\lab3-2.3\ADDED" folder
	- "Since the board with 7-segment display didn’t have connection port on a side that would be comfortable for us,
		we just have to keep in mind that LEDs have to be “inverted” when looking at photos." =>
		=> You can add here the the digits could be turned in the correct position by feeding "1"
		into the appropriate input PIN of the circuit (can be found in the Xilinx .icf file for the display), but we didn't do it for time reasons
