This program adds random numbers (10000100 in total) into a heap (all fully sorted),
then changes (decreases) the heap by removing the smallest numbers each time

The console output (with 1e5, since the process with 1e8 takes too long):

All items are added. Heap contains 100100 element now. Max count is 102400
All items are removed. Heap contains 0 element now. Max count is 102400
